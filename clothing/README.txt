 -- // INSTALLATION \\ --
 
 Please drop the 'clothing' folder into your server's addon folder and then create your entities within the entity folder using the
 templates given.
 For each entity you must only make a shared.lua file which can be copied over from other items including the starting default items.
 The config for each of the clothing items will have a range of options like scale, x, y, and x positioning, and rotating options.
 
 Using the commands below, you should be able to purge all clothing items that you have put on, please contact me with any bugs or issues :)
 

 To see the clothing, you must use a camera as they will not show up in first person mode, if needed i can add a config to do so but 
 that may cause a few issues, let me know if this is a required feature!

 All of the clothing items created with this will be able to be spawned upon restarting the server / restarting your singleplayer world
 as new files are registered on server / game startup.
